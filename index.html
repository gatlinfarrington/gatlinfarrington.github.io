            <p>Hi I'm Gatlin! I am a Junior at <span style="color: #FFC627">Arizona State University.</span> </p>

         <p>
              I am studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Cyber Security. Since Elementary school I've known that I wanted to go into a Computer Science field after joining an after school robotics program. From then on I made it my mission to never stop learning about programming and other STEM related activities. Java is the language I know best but I dabble in many others. I am familiar with: Python, HTML/CSS, C, C#, and Swift.
